5/6/2022,This package provides simulated tactile sensors for the Schunk Dextrous     Hand (SDH) which is mounted on the Care-O-bot arm. The node subscribes to     the Gazebo bumper topics of the SDH. It transforms the Gazebo feedback to     the "tactile_data" topic to provide the same tactile sensor interface as     the schunk_sdh package.     The following parameters can be set:     * cells_x: The number of patches on the tactile sensor in the direction                perpendicular to the finger. Defaults to 6.     * cells_y: The number of patches on the tactile sensor along the direction                of the finger. Defaults to 14.     * output_range: The maximum output value of one patch. Defaults to 3500.     * sensitivity: The change of output in one patch per Newton. Defaults to                    350. The sensitivity can be approximated by the following                    formula: S = output_range / (measurement_range * cell_area)                    - The measurement range of the tactile pads is 250 kPa (from                      the data sheet).                    - The output range can be determined by experiment from the                      real SDH. It is about 3500.                    - The cell area is the size of one patch. Length and width                      of the area are determined by dividing the length/width                      of the collision surface by the number of cells in the                      respective direction.                      Important: In most cases this is NOT the cell area that is                                 given in the data sheet!     * filter_length: The length of the moving average filter which smoothes                      the values from simulation. Defaults to 10.     The node subscribes to the following topics to receive data from the     simulation:     * thumb_2/state     * thumb_3/state     * finger_12/state     * finger_13/state     * finger_22/state     * finger_23/state     The node publishes the processed data on the following topic:     * tactile_data     The simulated bumper must obtain the collision data in the link that the     sensor is attached to.
