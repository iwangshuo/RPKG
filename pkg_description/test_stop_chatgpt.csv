2021/6/2,"TRAC-IK is a faster, significantly more reliable drop-in replacement for    KDL's pseudoinverse Jacobian solver.    The TRAC-IK library has a very similar API to KDL's IK solver calls,    except that the user passes a maximum time instead of a maximum number of    search iterations.  Additionally, TRAC-IK allows for error tolerances to    be set independently for each Cartesian dimension (x,y,z,roll,pitch.yaw).",trac_ik_lib,"IK,is,reliable,Jacobian TRAC IK,library,has,similar,API IK solver,user,maximum,time,maximum search TRAC,IK,allows error,Cartesian,."
