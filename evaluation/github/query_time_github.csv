88,plugins for transporting images,image_transport_plugins,"A set of plugins for publishing and subscribing to sensor_msgs/Image topics    in representations other than raw pixel data. For example, for viewing a    stream of images off-robot, a video codec will give much lower bandwidth    and latency. For low frame rate tranport of high-definition images, you    might prefer sending them as JPEG or PNG-compressed form.",transporting images plugins,https://github.com/search?q=,&section=pkgs,https://github.com/search?q=transporting images plugins&section=pkgs&p=1,259,199,458

90,track moving edges with ViSP,visp_tracker,Wraps the ViSP moving edge tracker provided by the ViSP visual    servoing library into a ROS package.    This computer vision algorithm computes the pose (i.e. position    and orientation) of an object in an image. It is fast enough to    allow object online tracking using a camera.,track moving edges ViSP,https://github.com/search?q=,&section=pkgs,https://github.com/search?q=track moving edges ViSP&section=pkgs&p=1,75,,
91,model based tracker with ViSP,visp_auto_tracker,"Online automated pattern-based object tracker relying on visual servoing.    visp_auto_tracker wraps model-based trackers provided by ViSP visual    servoing library into a ROS package. The tracked object should have a    QRcode of Flash code pattern. Based on the pattern, the object is    automaticaly detected. The detection allows then to initialise the    model-based trackers. When lost of tracking achieves a new detection    is performed that will be used to re-initialize the tracker.    This computer vision algorithm computes the pose (i.e. position and    orientation) of an object in an image.
