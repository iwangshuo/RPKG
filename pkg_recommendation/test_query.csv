1,"discover other R
OS masters",master_discovery_fkie,Discover the running ROS Masters in local network. The      discovering is done by sending an echo heartbeat messages to a defined      multicast group.     The alternative is to use a zeroconf/avahi daemon to register the ROS      master as service and discover other ROS masters.,"discover other R
