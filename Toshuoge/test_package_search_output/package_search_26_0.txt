Based on your query, here are 20 ROS packages that are most related to your requirements:

1. map_server: Provides a ROS node for serving map data from a map.yaml file.
2. gmapping: Implements a 2D grid-based mapping algorithm for creating occupancy grid maps from laser and pose data.
3. cartographer: A system that provides real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor configurations.
4. hector_mapping: A SLAM approach that can be used without odometry as well as on platforms that exhibit roll/pitch motion (e.g., multirotor UAVs).
5. octomap_mapping: A ROS package that implements an octree-based 3D occupancy mapping system.
6. rtabmap: A RGB-D Graph SLAM approach that uses a memory management approach to handle large-scale environments.
